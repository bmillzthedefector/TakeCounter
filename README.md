## Organization 
This app has two major components; a web app and an Electron app.
The web app is built such that when it's operating in an Electron 
environment, it has enhanced capabilities. Otherwise it behaves 
exactly the same whether on the native app or the web. The web app
and Electron app are in their respective folders.
